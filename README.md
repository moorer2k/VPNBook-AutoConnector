# VPNBook-AutoConnector
Automates the process of getting the latest user/pass from VPNBook. 
Allows the user to select the desired free servers, afterwhich it adds a new "temp" VPN connection for VPNBook.

The process is fully automated and the temporary VPN connection is removed once you decide to stop it.
